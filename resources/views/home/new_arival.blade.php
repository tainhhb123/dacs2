                  - Our quirky, sustainable photo frames are a great way to show off your favourite memories in style. Hand crafted from recycled newspaper, each one is as unique as it is colourful. The perfect planet-friendly present to celebrate a new home, wedding or birthday.
                </p>
                <p>- These frames have an attached stand, to be placed either portrait or landscape on a flat surface.</p>
                <p>- There’s no glass or plastic cover over the window, and no fiddly hooks to place the photo in the frame at the back – just a discrete slot to slip it through at the top. No fuss, no un-planet-friendly materials!</p>
